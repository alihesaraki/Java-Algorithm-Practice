# Algorithms: N-Queens Problem and Tower of Hanoi

This repository contains implementations of two classic algorithms: the N-Queens Problem and the Tower of Hanoi.

## 1. N-Queens Problem

The **N-Queens Problem** is a classic algorithmic problem that challenges the solver to place N queens on an N x N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Key Features
- The algorithm uses a backtracking approach to find all possible arrangements of N queens on the board.
- It ensures that no two queens attack each other by checking their positions.
- If a solution exists, it prints the chessboard configuration with queens represented by 'Q' and empty spaces by '.'.
