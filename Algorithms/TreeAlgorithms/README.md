# Tree Algorithms

This repository contains Java classes that implement various tree algorithms. Trees are hierarchical data structures that are widely used in computer science for various applications, including searching, sorting, and data organization. The following algorithms are included:

## 1. Balanced Binary Search Tree (AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree)
- **Description:** This class implements balanced binary search trees, which ensure that the tree remains balanced after insertions and deletions. AVL trees and Red-Black trees are two common types of balanced trees that provide efficient search operations.

## 2. Segment Tree
- **Description:** This class implements a segment tree, a data structure that allows efficient range queries and updates. Segment trees are particularly useful for answering range queries, such as sum or minimum in a range, in logarithmic time.
