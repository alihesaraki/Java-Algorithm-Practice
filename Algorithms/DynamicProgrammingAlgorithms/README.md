# Algorithms: Fibonacci Sequence and 0/1 Knapsack Problem

This repository contains implementations of two fundamental algorithms: the Fibonacci Sequence and the 0/1 Knapsack Problem.

## 1. Fibonacci Sequence

The **Fibonacci Sequence** is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence commonly appears in mathematics and nature.

### Key features:
- Recursive implementation to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
- Prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

### Example:
- For n = 10, the Fibonacci sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.

## 2. 0/1 Knapsack Problem

The **0/1 Knapsack Problem** is a combinatorial optimization problem. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, the goal is to determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

### Key features:
- Dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
- Maximizes the value within the given capacity of the knapsack.

### Example:
- Given weights = [10, 20, 30] and values = [60, 100, 120] with a capacity of 50, the maximum value in the knapsack is 220.
