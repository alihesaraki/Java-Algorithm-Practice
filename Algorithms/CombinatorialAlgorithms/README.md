# Algorithms: Permutations and Combinations

This repository contains implementations of two important combinatorial algorithms: Permutations and Combinations.

## 1. Permutations

**Permutations** refer to the different arrangements of a set of items. The order of arrangement is important. This algorithm generates all possible arrangements of a given array.

### Key Features
- Uses a backtracking approach to generate permutations.
- Swaps elements to create different arrangements.
- Outputs all unique permutations of the given array.

### Example
- For the input array `[1, 2, 3]`, the output will be:

## 2. Combinations

**Combinations** refer to the selection of items from a larger set where the order of selection does not matter. This algorithm generates all possible combinations of a specified length from a given number of items.

### Key Features
- Utilizes a backtracking approach to generate combinations.
- Maintains a list of the current combination and adds items recursively.
- Outputs all unique combinations of the specified length.

### Example
- For `n = 4` and `r = 2`, the output will be:
