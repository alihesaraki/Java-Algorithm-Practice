# Java Algorithm Practice

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in Java for practice and learning purposes. Each algorithm is implemented in its own class.

## Algorithms Included
 
1. **Merge Sort**
    - Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
    - **Usage:** Create an instance of `MergeSort` and call the `sort` method with the array you want to sort.

2. **Quick Sort**
    - Quick Sort is also a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array around the pivot.
    - **Usage:** Create an instance of `QuickSort` and call the `sort` method with the array you want to sort.

3. **Heap Sort**
    - Heap Sort utilizes a binary heap data structure to sort elements. It first builds a max heap and then sorts the array by repeatedly removing the largest element.
    - **Usage:** Create an instance of `HeapSort` and call the `sort` method with the array you want to sort.

4. **Bubble Sort**
    - Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
    - **Usage:** Create an instance of `BubbleSort` and call the `sort` method with the array you want to sort.

5. **Insertion Sort**
    - Insertion Sort builds a sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking an element from the input data and inserting it into the correct position.
    - **Usage:** Create an instance of `InsertionSort` and call the `sort` method with the array you want to sort.
